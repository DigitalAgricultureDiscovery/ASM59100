# ASM59100 Data Visualization Tools and Applications

This course is designed for students with little or no background in Data Visualization. It provides an introductory examination of the visualization process through lectures, readings, and hands-on experience with current visualization tools. Students will be provided with hands-on experience in Internet of Things (IoTs) sensors for real-time data acquisition, processing, and visualization using edge computing. They will be involved in running deep learning models on the edge device for computer vision. Participatory collaboration among students will be encouraged. By the end of this course, foundational knowledge and experience with analyzing data, visualization techniques & tools, and edge computing will enable students to visualize their own data and be prepared for intensive applications of edge devices in subsequent courses.
